    <h2>Plastic Antweights</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Plastic antweights are a 1 lb combat robotics weight class in which all components (frame, weapon, etc.) must be made from 3D-printed plastics, 
      with non-plastics permitted only for electronics, fasteners, and small functional inserts. This constraint emphasizes design-for-manufacturing and optimized geometry 
      over raw material strength, while allowing for more experimentation in comparison to heavier weight classes.

              <p>Skadoosh is a 1 lb plastic combat robot developed as a direct successor to Eggsterminator, refining its core survivability-focused design. 
              It features an improved direct-drive asymmetrical vertical spinner, two-wheel drive, and a revised, experimental angled exterior designed to both deflect 
              opposing weapons and enable limited physical control of opponents without the usage of "forks". The chassis was further optimized for FFF printing, preserving 
              print-oriented layer alignment for impact resistance while improving the modular armor system to allow faster, localized replacement after damage.</p>

                <p>Drawing upon experience, my teammate and I decided to design the successor to Eggsterminator. We thought that simply improving upon the previous design 
                would be rather bland, so we decided to experiment with a concave front wedge geometry. The inspiration was from Dorito, a 1lb control bot designed by a team I mentored
                that joined in the 2025-2026 school year. Their front crescent shape worked better than everyone expected, but had some clear downsides, especially in durability. 
                As such, we planned to utilize a similar concept for the front of our new bot while addressing the downsides.</p>
                <p>The image on the left demonstrates a quick but crude visualization of our idea, which we iterated upon.</p>

              <p>
                Eggsterminator is a 1 lb plastic combat robot designed with survivability as the primary constraint. It features a direct-drive symmetrical vertical 
                spinning weapon with steel screw inserts, two-wheel drive, and an angled exterior to deflect opposing weapons. The chassis geometry was optimized for FFF 
                printing, with layer-line orientation chosen to maximize impact resistance and modular armor sections that enable localized replacement after damage 
                rather than requiring a full chassis spare.

              <div class="project-block-text">
                <p>Being new to combat robotics, I designed the first concept without referencing existing bots. After reviewing suggested weapon types from the leads, 
                and considering the benefits and drawbacks of each type, I settled on a vertical spinner. The first rough CAD reflects this initial concept. 
                It was presented during the first of three design reviews held by the student organization, where valuable feedback was provided.</p>

              <div class="project-block-text">
                <p>With the initial CAD being very rough, a redesign took place, utilizing similar geometry. At this point, the concept of armor modularity was now realized, 
                    alongside the idea of making all exterior parts angled. Most bots only have an angled wedge in the front; by having angled parts all around, the robot would have
                    superior protection in comparison to existing designs.
                    Two slightly different CAD versions were made, with the one chosen being visible on the left.</p>

                <p>Changes from DR2: thicker weapon rails, all screws modeled, improved weapon rail mounting. Further changes: making the back plate flate to save weight,

                <p>Results: 2nd place, longest winning streak of the competition. Lost due to lack of invertibility; robot was able to drive upside-down, but was unable to 
                    self-right thus rendering the weapon useless.
                </p>
                <p>Lessons: angled geometry was extremely effective; no parts were replaced throughtout the entire competition. Invertibility is extremely important; the unexpected
                    will inevitably occur, leading to a loss if not planned for.
                </p>
                <p>Next Steps: utilize lessons for future bots, possibly revamp robot for future 1 lb competitions.</p>
